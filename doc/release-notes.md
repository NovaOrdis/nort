* Upgraded novaordis-utilities to a version higher then 4.2.2, which contained a OS implementation defect. Current
  version also provides better support for DEBUG-logging the content generated by the underlying processes.

* Initial support for a per-project configuration file (.nort/project.yaml or project.yml). Configuration supported 
  so far:
  * 'os.command.to.get.installed.version'
  * 'installation.directory'

* Additional qualification sequence tests (installed version constraints).

* Added support for externally configurable release tag ('release.tag' in the publish sequence configuration).
